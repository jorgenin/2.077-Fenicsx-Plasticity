# 2.077-Fenicsx-Plasticity
Implementation of Plasticity in Fenicsx

This is an implementation of Plasticity based upon Prof. Anand's 2.073 class notes for a 2.077 project

We hope to extend this to have a full finite elsasticity for large deformations, but frist version is based upson just small deformations.


## Structure
- 1D Plasticity
  - This is a small strain 1D plasticity example
- 3D Elasticity
  - Example of just 3D elasticity
- 3d Plasticity
  - An extended version of the 3D Elasticity to include plasticity
